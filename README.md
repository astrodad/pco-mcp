# Planning Center Online API and MCP Server Integration  

This project integrates the Planning Center Online (PCO) API with an MCP server to enable seamless interaction with a Large Language Model (LLM). The goal is to allow users to ask questions and retrieve data from Planning Center in a conversational manner.  

## Features  
- **PCO API Integration**: Connects to Planning Center Online to access and manage data.  
- **MCP Server**: Acts as a middleware to handle requests and responses between the LLM and PCO API.  
- **LLM Query Support**: Enables natural language queries to fetch and manipulate data from Planning Center.  

## Use Cases  
- Retrieve information about events, groups, or people in Planning Center.  
- Automate workflows by querying and updating data using natural language.  
- Provide insights and analytics through conversational queries.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Access to the [Planning Center API](https://developer.planningcenteronline.com/).  
- MCP server setup.  
- API keys for authentication.  

### Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
    ```bash  
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pco-mcp-integration.git  
    ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
    ```bash  
    npm install  
    ```  
3. Configure environment variables:  
    - `PCO_API_KEY`: Your Planning Center API key.  
    - `MCP_SERVER_URL`: URL of the MCP server.  

4. Start the server:  
    ```bash  
    npm start  
    ```  

## Usage  
1. Send a natural language query to the MCP server.  
2. The server processes the query and interacts with the PCO API.  
3. Receive a structured response or perform the requested action.
